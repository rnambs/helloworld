## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="compressed_headshot.jpg">

I'm a senior at the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in Computer Science. I'm interested and involved in everything software, data, product, and finance. Currently, I'm a Teaching Assistant for [CIS 5500](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/courses/cis-550-database-information-systems/){:target="\_blank"} at Penn Engineering, a course on Databases and Information Systems.

I'm also co-founder at [Jochi](https://www.jochi.info/){:target="\_blank"} with [Yash Dhir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashdhir/){:target="\_blank"}, a platform to simplify school and learning for students and administrators. If you know anyone interested in EdTech, or if you just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-nambiar27/){:target="\_blank"}!

## Experiences

Here is a quick run-through of what I've been doing for the past few years.

## Courses

I've had the chance to take very interesting courses at Penn Engineering and Wharton that have guided me to explore the world of data science, finance, and software engineering. Some of these include: CIS 5020: **Analysis of Algorithms**, CIS 5450: **Big Data Analytics**, CIS 5210: **Artificial Intelligence**, EAS 5450: **Entrepreneurship** (with a focus on VC strategy and quantitative financing techniques), MGMT 2670: **Entrepreneurship and Technological Innovation**.

I'd love to chat about any/all of these, and you can see their impact in everything I strive to do!

## Projects

**Apple Wallet Pass Creator:** I created a standalone app using Java & Spring to create Apple Wallet passes - you can extend the code to create any type of pass you like. This was an extension of my internship project at Rhombus, and not only was it one of the most fun ones I've done, I learnt a lot about cryptography through hashing algorithms and package signing, building microservices through Spring, working with DynamoDB and cloud services, and UI/UX.

**Penn Garage:** Worked with 4 friends as an extension of CIS 3500 - Software Engineering. Penn Garage is a (integrated with Penn systems) marketplace that allows students to easily trade/sell items. One of the biggest problems at Penn is the hassle during move-out/move-in, and this allows students to save money and time in a safe and eco-friendly manner. Built on MERN stack.

**Superscalar Pipelined Processor:** Built a 5-stage superscalar processor for CIS 5710 - a graduate-level course on computer architecture. Includes a fully pipelined, complete bypassing structure and can complete a single cycle in ~60ns. Inspired by the MIPS processor architecture, built primarily using Verilog.

**Where2Move:** Created a React-powered app on an AWS SQL server using Express with 3 friends to help users determine the next best place to move. Inputting weather, rent, cost of living, transportation, and 4 other factors outputs the top locations on an interactive map that best suits your preferences. This was a fun project for CIS 5500 - for which I'm a teaching assistant right now - and showed me the importance of query optimization using caching and indexing to boost the efficiency of deployed applications.

**Fun Projects:** I've had the chance to work on many cool mini-projects through my courses: here are a few of them. Built a fully functional compiler in C for the J programming language for the final project of CIS 2400 - Computer Systems. Translated J code to LC4 - Penn's internal ISA, and was able to connect to an internal simulator to play games such as Wordle. Also built Minesweeper for a class - one of my first OOP products!

## Boring stuff

A lot of my projects have to be in private GitHub repos due to academic integrity rules. If you're interested in any of them, contact me and I'll be happy to chat about them!
