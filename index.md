## Hi - I'm Rahul

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

I'm a junior at the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in Computer Science. I'm interested and involved in everything programming, data, product, and finance.

Right now, I spend most of my time leading the tech efforts for [Jochi](https://www.jochi.info/), which simplifies online school and learning for students and administrators - a massive problem that my co-founder and I faced. If you know of schools or administrators that could benefit from this, feel free to reach out to me!

I'm also building **Penn Garage** - a MERN stack marketplace application to allow Penn students to buy/sell/trade items in a safe and convenient way. Currently, I work as a Teaching Assistant for [CIS 5500 - Databases](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/courses/cis-550-database-information-systems/) - a graduate level course on  Databases, Information Systems, and Data Management - working with Professor Susan Davidson.

## Experiences

Here is a quick run through of what I've been doing the past few years.

Year | Where | What
-----|-------|--------
2023 | University of Pennsylvania  | CIS 5500 Teaching Assistant
2023 | Jochi | Co-founder, Tech Lead
2022 | National Basketball Association | Software Engineer Intern
2021 | Wharton Asia Exchange | Trading Analyst (Quant Team)
2020 | Occasions | Freelance Web Development

## Projects

**Penn Garage:** Working with Professor Fouh as an extension of CIS 3500 - Software Engineering at Penn. Penn Garage is an (integrated with Penn systems) marketplace that allows students to easily trade/sell items. One of the biggest problems at Penn is the waste during move-out/move-in, and this allows students to save money, time, and the environment - all in a safe and personalized way.

**Superscalar Pipelined Processor:** Currently building a 5 stage superscalar processor for CIS 5710 - a graduate level course on computer architecture. Includes a fully pipelined, complete bypassing structure and can complete a single cycle in ~60ns. Inspired my the MIPS processor architecture.

**Where2Move:** I built a React powered app on an AWS SQL server using Express to help users determine the next best place to move. Inputting weather, rent, cost of living, transportation, and 4 other factors outputs the top locations on an interactive map that best suit your preferences. This was a fun project for CIS 5500 - for which I'm a teaching assistant right now - and showed me the importance of query optimization using caching and indexing to boost the efficiency of client-side applications.

**J Compiler:** Built a fully functional compiler in C for the J programming language for the final project of CIS 2400 - Computer Systems. Translated J code to LC4 - Penn's internal ISA, and was able to connect to an internal simulator to play games such as Wordle.
