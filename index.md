## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="compressed_headshot.jpg">

I'm a senior at the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in Computer Science. I'm interested and involved in everything software, data, product, and finance. Currently, I'm a Software Engineering Intern at Rhombus, working on their new [Access Control](https://www.rhombus.com/access-control/){:target="_blank"}.

I'm also co-founder at [Jochi](https://www.jochi.info/){:target="_blank"} with [Yash Dhir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashdhir/){:target="_blank"}, a platform to simplify school and learning for students and administrators. If you know anyone interested in EdTech, or if you just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-nambiar27/){:target="_blank"}!

## Projects

**Apple Wallet Pass Creator:** Ever wanted to make your own Apple Wallet pass, just like the credit/transit cards? I created a standalone app using Java & Spring to do just this - you can extend the code to create any type of pass you like. This was an extension of my internship project at Rhombus, and not only was it one of the most fun ones I've done, I learnt a lot about cryptography through hashing algorithms and package signing, building microservices through Spring, working with iOS, and UI/UX.

**Penn Garage:** Worked with Professor Fouh and 4 friends as an extension of CIS 3500 - Software Engineering. Penn Garage is a (integrated with Penn systems) marketplace that allows students to easily trade/sell items. One of the biggest problems at Penn is the hassle during move-out/move-in, and this allows students to save money and time in a safe and eco-friendly manner. Built on MERN stack.

**Superscalar Pipelined Processor:** Built a 5-stage superscalar processor for CIS 5710 - a graduate-level course on computer architecture. Includes a fully pipelined, complete bypassing structure and can complete a single cycle in ~60ns. Inspired by the MIPS processor architecture, built primarily using Verilog.

**Where2Move:** Created a React-powered app on an AWS SQL server using Express with 3 friends to help users determine the next best place to move. Inputting weather, rent, cost of living, transportation, and 4 other factors outputs the top locations on an interactive map that best suits your preferences. This was a fun project for CIS 5500 - for which I'm a teaching assistant right now - and showed me the importance of query optimization using caching and indexing to boost the efficiency of deployed applications.

**Fun Projects:** I've had the chance to work on many cool mini-projects through my courses: here are a few of them. Built a fully functional compiler in C for the J programming language for the final project of CIS 2400 - Computer Systems. Translated J code to LC4 - Penn's internal ISA, and was able to connect to an internal simulator to play games such as Wordle. Also built Minesweeper for a class - one of my first OOP products!
