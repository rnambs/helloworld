I'm co-founder at [Jochi](https://www.jochi.info/){:target="_blank"}, where we're streamlining and empowering academic support centres at K-12 schools to better identify and support students with learning differences. I recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where I pursued a major in Computer Science. At Penn Engineering, I was Teaching Assistant for [CIS 5500: Databases and Information Systems](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/courses/cis-550-database-information-systems/){:target="_blank"}. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-nambiar27/){:target="_blank"} if you're interested in EdTech or just want to chat!

## [Jochi](https://www.jochi.info/){:target="_blank"}

For students, [Jochi](https://www.jochi.info/){:target="_blank"} is a digital planner that *integrates* with schools' existing learning management systems to pull academic information like *grades, assignments, and tasks*, and then provides tools for assignment organization, effective studying, and accessing support.

Educators leverage Jochi for the wealth of data we provide about how a student is performing inside and outside the classroom. In just a few clicks, they have a complete overview of what their students are working on, where they're falling behind, and key behaviors that are integral to provide targeted support. Jochi also automates the entire process of tracking, monitoring, and reporting to parents or administrators, *saving educators up to 5 hours per week*.

Jochi recently won some of the largest awards in higher education from the University of Pennsylvania. Learn more about our impact and vision in these features:

## Projects

**Apple Wallet Pass Creator:** I developed an app to create Apple Wallet passes during my internship at Rhombus, learning about cryptography, microservices, and UI/UX design.

**Penn Garage:** As part of CIS 3500 - Software Engineering, my team developed a marketplace integrated with Penn systems to facilitate item trading among students, focusing on sustainability and convenience.

**Superscalar Pipelined Processor:** For CIS 5710, I built a 5-stage superscalar processor inspired by MIPS architecture, implemented in Verilog, and capable of completing a cycle in approximately 60 ns.
