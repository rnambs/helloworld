I'm Co-Founder and CTO at [Jochi](www.jochi.com){:target="_blank"} where we're helping leading independent schools admit and retain students with data-driven decisions. I recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where I pursued a major in Computer Science.

At Penn, my co-founder and I won the [President's Innovation Prize](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/presidents-innovation-prize-making-life-easier-students-learning-differences-jochi){:target="_blank"}, the biggest award of it's kind in higher education, and got additional grant-funding from the [Draper Foundation and UPenn's Venture Lab](https://venturelab.upenn.edu/news/jochi-venture-labs-2024-startup-challenge-winner-takes-home-the-presidents-innovation-prize){:target="_blank"}. I was also a Teaching Assistant for [CIS 5500: Databases and Information Systems](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/courses/cis-550-database-information-systems/){:target="_blank"} at Penn Engineering.

## Courses

At Penn Engineering and Wharton, I took several courses that deepened my interest in data science, finance, and software engineering:

- CIS 5020: **Analysis of Algorithms**
- CIS 5450: **Big Data Analytics**
- CIS 5210: **Artificial Intelligence**
- EAS 5450: **Entrepreneurship** (focus on VC strategy)
- MGMT 2670: **Entrepreneurship and Technological Innovation**

## Projects

**Apple Wallet Pass Creator:** I developed an app to create Apple Wallet passes during my internship at Rhombus, learning about cryptography, microservices, and UI/UX design.

**Penn Garage:** As part of CIS 3500 - Software Engineering, my team developed a marketplace integrated with Penn systems to facilitate item trading among students, focusing on sustainability and convenience.

**Superscalar Pipelined Processor:** For CIS 5710, I built a 5-stage superscalar processor inspired by MIPS architecture, implemented in Verilog, and capable of completing a cycle in approximately 60 ns.
