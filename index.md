- CIS 5450: **Big Data Analytics**
- CIS 5210: **Artificial Intelligence**
- EAS 5450: **Entrepreneurship** (focus on VC strategy)
- MGMT 2670: **Entrepreneurship and Technological Innovation**

## Projects

**Apple Wallet Pass Creator:** I developed an app to create Apple Wallet passes during my internship at Rhombus, learning about cryptography, microservices, and UI/UX design.

**Penn Garage:** As part of CIS 3500 - Software Engineering, my team developed a marketplace integrated with Penn systems to facilitate item trading among students, focusing on sustainability and convenience.

**Superscalar Pipelined Processor:** For CIS 5710, I built a 5-stage superscalar processor inspired by MIPS architecture, implemented in Verilog, and capable of completing a cycle in approximately 60 ns.
